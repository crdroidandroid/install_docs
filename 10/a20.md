### Prerequisites
* Your Samsung Galaxy A20
** This will NOT work on the A20e or A20s
* USB-C cable that can do data transfer
* A computer running Windows XP or later
* A MicroSD card that's at least 2GB

### Unlocking bootloader
This **WILL** factory reset your phone. Back up any data before continuing.
* Open Settings, and go to About phone -> Software information
* Tap "Build number" 7 times
* Go back, then select "Developer options"
* Enable "OEM unlocking", and press "Enable" on the warning
** If the OEM unlocking option doesn't exist, your phone is not unlockable (likely it was purchased from a carrier like Verizon that restricts unlocking) and you cannot continue.
* Turn off the phone
* Hold down volume down and volume up, and while doing this, plug the phone into your computer.
* Once the Warning screen appears, let go of all buttons.
* Hold down volume up until it says "Unlock bootloader?", then press volume up again.

### Installing TWRP
You will have to install Odin and the Samsung USB drivers on a computer, which requires Windows XP or later. 
* Turn the phone off
* Hold down volume down and volume up and plug the phone into your computer.
* When the Warning screen appears, let go of all buttons.
* Press volume up to enter download mode.
* Get twrp-3.7.0_9-0-a20.img.tar from https://twrp.me/samsung/samsunggalaxya20.html
* Open Odin, and select the tar file you just downloaded for AP.
* Go to "Options", and verify "Re-Partition" is unchecked. Having it checked may result in a brick.
* Press "Start"
* When it finishes, your phone will reboot back into download mode.
* Download https://xdaforums.com/attachments/samsung_vbmeta-tar.5065877/, select that file for AP, and press start again.
* When the phone reboots, hold down volume up and power until it boots into TWRP

### Installing crDroid
* Download the latest crDroid build from https://crdroid.net/a20/10
* Copy the file to a MicroSD card
** ADB sideload doesn't work on some A20's for whatever reason, so it is recommended to use a MicroSD to install crDroid.
* Insert the SD card into your phone.
* In TWRP, press "Wipe", then "Advanced Wipe"
* Select "System", "Data", "Cache", and "Dalvik / ART Cache"
* Swipe to wipe
* Go back to TWRP's main menu
* Press "Install" in TWRP
* Go to "Select Storage", and pick "Micro SD Card"
* Select the crDroid zip
* Swipe to install, and wait several minutes for it to install
* If wanted, you can also install GApps.

Congratulations! crDroid has been installed on your phone.
